# Malaria_Detection
Detection of Malarial Parasite in Blood Smears Using Image Processing.
Malaria is a serious global disease and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical and
sub-tropical countries. It affects between 350 and 500 million people and causes more than 1
million deaths every year. Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease mainly caused by the plasmodium
parasites carried by a mosquito of Anopheles genus. Mainly there are five kinds of Plasmodium
parasites namely plasmodium falciparum, plasmodium vivax, plasmodium malariae, plasmodium
ovale and plasmodium knowlesi. Malaria infection will be identified mainly by patient’s
symptoms and by testing the blood samples. Whereas symptoms will gives intimation about the
disease but it will be confirmed only after proper testing. But the limitations is that if the malaria
infected patient belongs to rural areas then for testing the blood expertized person is required to
diagnose the blood and also if he is available, he may take two or three days to give the reports
depending on the patients he need to handle. Since because of microscopic images contains very
minute things, technician must be free from eye site. Also every processes involved will be
manual and hence chances of getting error report will be more. Even the person in the urban areas
will also have to face many problems such as they have to pay more money to diagnostic centres
and also some amount of time required to get the report.
By considering all these conditions the problem will be solved by proper diagnosis and by
implementing an automation system for processing the microscopic images of blood. All this will
be set and done by employing a MatLab software and Image processing (segmentation) to
process the image and to count the number of cells infected. To achieve this, automation process
will involve the multi-thresholding of Otsu’s method for proper diagnosis and for counting the
total number of infected cells will be carried out using watershed algorithm and connected
component extraction.

Steps to Run the Program :
1. Run malaria_gui.m
2. Click on Image Acquision Button when the GUI is loaded. Select any Infected Image.
3. Run All the tests sequentially.
